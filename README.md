# AL_tutorial
A tutorial on how to build neural networks for potential energy surfaces of molecules. It was made for a [lecture on active learning]( https://www.notion.so/Active-learning-of-potential-energy-surface-591bdd84a30943ebbc51f97431f988eb), as part of a course on [scientific computing for molecular physics course]( https://www.notion.so/Scientific-computing-for-molecular-physics-b029aa1b4f4f4315a6147ed32d0f1879) by Andrey Yachmenev in university of Hamburg. The codes are based on [1], and the [accompanying codes]( https://github.com/CFEL-CMI/Active-Learning-of-PES).
